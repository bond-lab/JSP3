#  test different information from wordnet **WSD-W**

## Minimum

Get a tagger running on a cloud machine, using an existing model.  Run with different amounts of information from wordnet, and the lemmas and so forth.  Evaluate which works better.

## Desired

Automate the testing (maybe)?
 * watch [Let the LLM Write the Prompts: An Intro to DSPy in Compound AI Pipelines](https://youtu.be/I9ZtkgYZnOw?si=66uDbpaDWra9TaIj)

 * note model/information/context combinations

## Difficulty

* Many different possibilities, so need to plan how to test
* What works for English may not work fo Czech


## Notes 

* I have code, use that and adapt to collab/Kagle
