#  test different contexts **WSD-C**

## Minimum

Get a tagger running on a cloud machine, using an existing model.  Run with different contexts, evaluate which works better.

## Desired

Make it easy for other tasks to use (WSD-T)

Find models that can be used cheaply

## Difficulty

Not so hard, but results are slow, and free resources have cutoff


## Notes 

* I have code, use that and adapt to collab/Kagle
