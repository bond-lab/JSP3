#  test different contexts **WSD-C**

## Minimum

Align paragraphs and then sentences for multiple languages 
start with Czech-English

## Desired

* find epub, extract text, split into para, align
  * use: https://github.com/averkij/lingtrain-aligner/releases/tag/0.1.0
  * then add to **WSD-C**
* visualize texts
* generate for all texts in NTU-MC

## Difficulty

Not so hard, but results are slow, and free resources have cutoff


## Notes 

* I have code, use that and adapt to collab/Kagle
