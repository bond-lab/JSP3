#  test different models **WSD-M**

## Minimum

Get a tagger running on a cloud machine, using an existing model.  Run with different models, evaluate which works better.

## Desired

* Find a good Czech model
* Look at settings to make it more efficient
  *  e.g., prompt caching
* run on some SOA models (needs mony)


## Difficulty

Not so hard, but results are slow, and free resources have cutoff


## Notes 

* I have code, use that and adapt to collab/Kagle
